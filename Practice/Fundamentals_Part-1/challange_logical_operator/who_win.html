There are two gymnastics teams: Dolphins and Koalas. They compete against each other 3 times. 
The winner with the highest average score wins a trophy!

Your tasks:

 and print to the console:

"Dolphins win the trophy" if Dolphins win, or

"Koalas win the trophy" if Koalas win, or

"Both win the trophy" if their average scores are equal.
